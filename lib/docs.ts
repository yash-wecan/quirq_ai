/**
 * The documentation index.
 *
 * This page indexes material that already exists rather than restating it: the
 * unit-of-work guides are research notes, the reference pages are the site's
 * own engine documentation, and the paper is the paper. Every entry points at
 * something real, and adding an entry here means it exists first.
 *
 * The one deliberate exception is `RELEASE_NOTES`, which leaves for
 * docs.xo.builders, because versioned release notes are published there and
 * not on this site. A docs page that silently dropped the changelog it was
 * being linked from would be worse than one that says where it lives.
 *
 * Server-safe: plain serializable data, no JSX, no browser modules.
