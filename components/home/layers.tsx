 * The deck drew the colour rail as its own 23px grid column, which meant its
 * four row heights (304px, then 3 x 48px) had to be hard-coded to match the
 * accordion sitting next to it. Two columns agreeing on pixel heights by hand
 * is the single biggest source of the CSS this rebuild is replacing, and it
 * breaks the moment the copy reflows. Here each row carries its own 4px bar as
 * the first cell of its own grid, so the rail is aligned by structure: a row
 * that grows takes its colour with it and nothing has to be re-measured.
 */

 * The four tones, top to bottom. 01 is the only two-stop rail because OUTPUT is
 * where the stack resolves into delivered work; the rest are single spectrum
 * stops so the column reads as a descent rather than four competing gradients.

/**
 * The signature: the four bars draw down in sequence as the stack enters, which
 * is the one place on this page the full spectrum appears as structure instead
 * of as a hairline. `transformOrigin: top` is what makes it read as pouring
 * rather than growing from the middle.
 *
 * The bars carry no observer of their own, and that is the whole point. A bar
 * animating from `scaleY: 0` is a zero-area box, and a zero-area target is
 * exactly the case IntersectionObserver thresholds handle least predictably:
 * the three short rows fired and the tall one never did, so the stack shipped
 * with three of its four colours. The state comes from the stack instead, which
 * is a real box with a real height, and each bar just declares what it looks
 * like in each of the stack's two states.
 *
 * `self-stretch` rather than `h-full` for a second reason found the same way:
 * the collapsed rows have a definite height so `height: 100%` resolves there,
 * but the open card's row is sized by its copy, and against an indefinite grid
 * area 100% resolves to auto: an empty span, zero tall.
